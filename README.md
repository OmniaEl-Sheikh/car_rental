Excited to share my latest project, the Vehicles & Employees Management System, developed as being my first ever freelancing gig 🎉 

🌐 This comprehensive system, created in collaboration with my talented colleagues, is designed to streamline vehicle and employee management for companies, tailored specifically for a Saudi Arabia-based organization.

🔧 The Vehicles & Employees Management System offers robust functionalities for account management, employee management, and vehicle management. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and Angular 17 for the frontend, we've created a modern and efficient solution.

🎨 On the backend, we've leveraged ASP.NET Core Web API to provide RESTful endpoints, while Entity Framework simplifies database interactions. Microsoft SQL Server serves as the backbone for our data storage needs, ensuring reliability and scalability.

🌟 Our frontend, powered by Angular 17, delivers a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily register, log in, and manage employees and vehicles.
